## About the Mod:

This mod adds a new companion to take with you on your adventures. To get started, you'll need to craft the item version as such:

![Recipe](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/965080060421894204/1012925433047678976/crafting.png)

Once that's done, simply right-click the item on the ground to spawn Luggage into the world.

Luggage will follow you around wherever you go, picking up any items it can find on the ground. 

You can simply right-click Luggage to open its inventory, and you can add or remove items as you please.

If Luggage ends up getting struck by lightning, it will become charged and can carry double the amount of inventory space it could before. 

To turn Luggage back into an item, simply ``` SHIFT + Right Click ``` it. The item will automatically be added to your inventory if possible.

### There are 2 whistle commands that allow you to control Luggage a little more.
## Call Whistle
By pressing ``` ` ``` on your keyboard, you can call all your owned Luggages to you no matter where they are. (As long as the chunks they're in are loaded!) Calling for Luggage will put it on a 10-second cooldown from collecting items. 

## Wait Whistle
By pressing ``` ALT + ` ``` on your keyboard, you can command all Luggages you own in an 8 block radius to stay put. Any Luggage that is waiting around will sweat, as they don't like to stay still. Pressing the key again will allow it to move freely again.
